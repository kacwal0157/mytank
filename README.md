# Mytank game

## The game written in Unity using C# giving player unforgettable experience

This project was created as a fan project. It contains all good programing standards like DRY 
(don't repeat yourself) or class single responsibility. The game has many features like possibility to upgrade or modify tanks, everyday events, chest openings, level progress and many more! In future I would like to add:

* Social features (players can text with each other, create clans)
* Achievements system
* Custom maps creator
* Skins for tanks

## How to use this API

The easiest way to see how it works is to use Unity launcher available on their website. The latest version that I worked with was Unity 2022.3.1. I highly suggest to use it, eitherway some unknown errors could appear. To run the game follow steps below:

1. Open up Unity
2. Install proper version of Unity (that i mentioned ealier)
3. Add project to launcher by clicking in 'Add' sign and select folder that you cloned from my github
4. Open project
5. Run the game by clicking on Run button in opened Unity window.

## Interested in all features that the game have?

In the game, you can play specially created maps where increasingly more difficult opponents will await you. To face them, you need to gradually upgrade your tanks. Each of them has a unique way of shooting, during the game you will learn which type is best for a given opponent. The gold coins you get for playing the levels you've unlocked or through the daily wheel of fortune will help you upgrade! While playing, you will obtain unique items that will make the game easier. Interested? That's not all, because you will also improve your player profile to unlock amazing titles such as 'Tank Master'.

## Known issues

*What if I get an error that says: "`"Clear user preferences"`"?*

The program found that something on your computer has files that can interrupt the game. To solve that just find a tab in Unity called `"Edit"` (propably in your top left corner) and then click `"Clear All PlayerPrefs"`.
