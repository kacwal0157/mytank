Hello!
This set contains 10 models of different types of tanks. Each of them has its own material, that separate 
texture, which are located in the Materials and Texture folders, respectively.

A separate prefab is created for each model. It consists of a parent object, a model 
mesh and effects. The effects are attached to the corresponding parts of the tank. 
The Mesh Collider component has been added to the model mesh. To optimize the rendering of
 the collision, we used optimized meshes of the models. The model data is located in the mColliders folder.

To use the asset, just drag the desired model prefab into the scene from the Prefabs folder.

Happy game development!
