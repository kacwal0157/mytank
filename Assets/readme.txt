README - Ground Target System
-----------------------------
Thanks for purchasing the Ground Target System!

The Ground Target System solves the issue of selecting an object on uneven terrain and/or platforms.
Using this system you can also exclude layers that shouldn't receive the projected targets.
With over 200 textures and various animation capabilities the number of unique combinations are endless! 

This package contains:
	- 200+ hi-resolution textures which are used for the ground projections.
	- Scripts which animate the projectors during run-time with various effects.
	- Sample scripts to perform mouse click target selections.
	- A modified version of the StandardAssets/Projector/Light Shader.


Installation
------------
Once the assets have been imported simply use the built in editor extension to begin.
GameObject->Game Native->Ground Targets->Create

This will prompt you to save a GroundTarget.prefab and will also generate the material files.
Once the prefab has been generated drag it into your scene and edit the settings on the child objects.

*Video tutorials are available on the asset store page.
